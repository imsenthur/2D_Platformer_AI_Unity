# 2D_Platformer_AI_Unity
This is a 2D platformer developed in Unity game engine with pathfinding AI along with mobile onscreen controls and few sprite resources. This game includes few free assets from Unity Asset store. Feel free to look into it if you are interested in developing retro styled 2D platformer shoot'em up games. 

PS: Completely Opensource, but make sure you give credits to the assets included within it.
Mail me about your game in which you'll be implementing this, it means a lot to me.
Happy coding :)
